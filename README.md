# 2D Cook Website

A creative **2D animated cooking website** built as a learning project to understand **GSAP 2D animations**, **ScrollTrigger navigation**, and **Locomotive Scroll**.  
The project is designed as a **landing page followed by two animated sections**, where scrolling smoothly transitions the user from one section to the next.

## 🌟 Features

- 🧑‍🍳 **2D Cook Model Animation**
- 📄 **Landing Page** with animated introduction
- 🔄 **Scroll-based navigation** between sections
- 🎯 **GSAP ScrollTrigger** for smooth section transitions
- 🌀 **Locomotive Scroll** for smooth scrolling experience
- 🎨 Clean and visually engaging layout
- 🖥️ **Large-screen responsive only** (desktop-focused)

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the website
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Animation logic
- **GSAP** – 2D animations
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger** – Scroll-based section control
- **Locomotive Scroll** – Smooth scrolling effect

## 🧠 What I Learned From This Project

- How to animate **2D elements using GSAP**
- Using **ScrollTrigger** to control animations on scroll
- Navigating between sections using scroll-based triggers
- Integrating **Locomotive Scroll** with GSAP
- Creating smooth and interactive scroll experiences
- Building animation-focused layouts for large screens

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User lands on the **Landing Page**
2. Scrolling triggers GSAP animations
3. ScrollTrigger moves the view to the **next section**
4. Further scrolling navigates to the **final section**
5. Locomotive Scroll ensures smooth and fluid motion throughout
